## Why Mistfall
- **Structured schemas, zero guesswork.** Describe tables, constraints, and indexes with the DSL and let TypeScript enforce them across your app.
- **Operational clarity.** Typed CRUD helpers, predicates, and transactions mirror relational ergonomics without IndexedDB boilerplate.
- **Adapters for every surface.** Auto-switch between IndexedDB in browsers and memory in SSR/tests so features stay portable.
- **Docs that mirror code.** Every page references working demos (Todo + Ecommerce) so you can copy-paste production patterns.
