description: Entry point for framework integrations that pair Mistfall with Astro and future adapters.
---

Mistfall plugs into multiple environments. Start with Astro today and expect more framework guides here soon.

- [Astro Integration](/integrations/astro/)
- (Coming soon) Next.js / React Server Components
- (Coming soon) SvelteKit islands

Contributions welcome—open an issue if you’d like to document another integration.
